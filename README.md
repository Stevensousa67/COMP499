# Directed Study 1: Campgrounds Project

# Overview

This repository contains the source code for my Directed Study 1 project at Bridgewater State University. The focus of the project is to develop a full-stack application for managing campgrounds. It is part of my effort to deepen my understanding of software engineering principles and practices, especially in web development.

# Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive campgrounds management system, which allows users to:

	•	Explore available campgrounds
	•	View campground details
 	•	Create new campgrounds
	•	Leave reviews or feedback
 	•	User account management, such as creation, login, and sign-out

This project involves building both front-end and back-end components, along with database integration.

# Technologies

	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	•	Backend: Node.JS, Express
	•	Database: MongoDB
	•	Version Control: Git and GitHub
	•	Other Tools: Bootstrap
