This repository contains the source code for my YelpCamp! project. The focus of the project is to develop a full-stack application for managing campgrounds, where users can create, edit, review, and share campgrounds. It is part of my effort to deepen my understanding of software engineering principles and practices, especially in web development.

# Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive campgrounds management system, which allows users to:

	•	Explore available campgrounds
	•	View campground details
 	•	Create new campgrounds
	•	Leave reviews or feedback

This project is part of my effort to deepen my understanding of software engineering principles and practices, especially in web development.
